description: Perform a deep strategic dive into app logic, database schemas, and unique feature mechanics before coding.

# Brainstorming & Planning Workflow

Use this workflow to solve complex logic, map out databases, or design "Soulful" mechanics.

## 1. The Strategy Matrix
Define the following for the feature/app:
- **Core Logic**: How does the data move? What are the edge cases?
- **Database Schema**: Define tables, relationships, and index requirements.
- **UI Mechanics**: How does the "Soul" manifest in this specific interaction?
- **Security Check**: Are there potential vulnerabilities in this plan?

## 2. Visual Prototyping
// turbo
1. Use `generate_image` to visualize a specific complex state (e.g., an error dashboard or a data-dense panel).
2. Validate the flow with the user before committing to code.

## 3. The Implementation Plan
Generate an `implementation_plan.md` that breaks the brainstorm into executable tasks.
